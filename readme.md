# BookKeeper App

Personal app used to save chapters of books that are uploaded online per chapter into one file for offline reading.

## Why?

Cause I found it annoying to read each chapter on seperate webpages. Especially if I'm on an airplane and have no internet access

## Stack

- Python
- JSON
