# BookKeeper App

A webscraper/Personal app thing used to save chapters of books that are uploaded online per chapter into one file for offline reading.

## Why?

Cause I found it annoying to read each chapter on seperate webpages. Especially if I'm on an airplane and have no internet access

## Stack

- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - Powerful, easy to learn programming language.
- JSON - used as an API for tracking chapter updates
